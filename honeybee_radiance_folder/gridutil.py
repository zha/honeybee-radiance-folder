    """Create new sensor grids folder with evenly distributed sensors.

    This function creates a new folder with evenly distributed sensor grids. The folder
    will include a ``_redist_info.json`` file which has the information to recreate the
    original input files from this folder and the results generated based on the grids
    in this folder.

    ``_redist_info.json`` file includes an array of JSON objects. Each object has the
    ``id`` or the original file and the distribution information. The distribution
    information includes the id of the new files that the sensors has been distributed
    to and the start and end line in the target file.

    This file is being used to restructure the data that is generated based on the newly
    created sensor grids.

    Args:
        input_folder: Input sensor grids folder.
        output_folder: A new folder to write the newly created files.
        grid_count: Number of output sensor grids to be created. This number
            is usually equivalent to the number of processes that will be used to run
            the simulations in parallel.
        min_sensor_count: Minimum number of sensors in each output grid. Use this number
            to ensure the number of sensors in output grids never gets very small. To
            ignore this limitation set the value to 1. This value always takes precedence
            over grid_count. Default: 2000.
        extension: Extension of the files to collect data from. Default is ``pts`` for
            sensor files. Another common extension is ``csv`` for generic data sets.
        grid_info: Optional list of dictionaries with grid information. Use this instead
            of the expected _info.json file in the input_folder.
        verbose: Set to True to get verbose reporting. Default: False.

    Returns:
        A tuple with three elements

        - grid_count: Number of output sensor grids. Keep in mind that this number can
          be adjusted based on the min_sensor_count.

        - sensor_per_grid: Number of sensors in each newly created sensor grid.

        - out_grid_info: Grid information as written to _info.json.
